    <!-- Inline JavaScript code is where you write it in the index.html file. This would make the html file really long. Best practice is to make a new file and include the script tag to access the file in the index.html file -->
    <!-- <script type="text/javascript">
          console.log("Hello World!");
    </script> -->
    <!-- Write file externally in project folder and include script tag to access from index.html -->
    <script type="text/javascript" src="script.js">

    </script>
